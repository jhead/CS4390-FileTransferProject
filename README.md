# File Transfer Server/Client
#### For CS4390: Computer Networks

This is terrible, I'm aware. Please don't judge me.

## Usage
```shell
Usage:
          java -jar FileTransferProject.jar --server <port>
          java -jar FileTransferProject.jar --client <host> <port> <file>
          java -jar FileTransferProject.jar --tcp <host> <port> <file>
          java -jar FileTransferProject.jar --udp <host> <port> <file>
```

## Caveats
It probably doesn't work. I wouldn't suggest running it. Seriously, don't do it.
